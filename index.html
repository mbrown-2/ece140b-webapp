           <p>PlantPal is the solution to your plant-caretaking woes. Our product consists of a packaged set of small meters that are inserted
            in the soil near the base of plants that you wish to track. These meters come with pre-installed batteries as well as mini solar panels
            to achieve energy sustainability for both indoor and outdoor environments.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>PlantPal is partnered with a free, downloadable app that centralizes and simplifies your experience with our product.
            This app will contain several features, such as a "plant profiling" system in which users define the type of plant that
            each unique meter is measuring. Based on these descriptions, the PlantPal meters will adapt their rate of reminders to
            produce more-specialized results.

          <h1>Product Details</h1>

          <h4>The goal of our team is to create and introduce a product that will minimize the stress of
            plant-caretaking and help users improve their gardening awareness. PlantPal is a device two
            key integrations: <u>a hardware and software side of things</u>.
          </h4>

          <div class="flexbox-description">
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The Hardware:</b> Each meter of our PlantPal package comes with a central raspberry pi
              device (all tucked within a protective shell/case) and an extending meter. This meter sticks 
              into the soil of a nearby plant and periodically obtains data. This data includes measurements 
              of important factors such as <b>soil moisture, temperature, and humidity</b>. Every 30 minutes,
              data is forwarded via wifi to a remote server that will collect and store our data in an SQL database.
            </p>
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The software:</b> The data is aimed to be hosted on Microsoft Azure for security and reliability.
              As data is collected, a user will be able to check on this information via an iOS application on their
              mobile device. This app will retrieve data and display information in a clean and graphical layout.
              Some implementations you can expect are charts that visually describe a plant's conditions over time
              and custom settings that allow you to describe the breed and dimensions of the plants you are 
              taking care of.
            </p>
          </div>


          <h1>Is this product for me?</h1>

          <p>As long as you own a mobile device, some plants that need watering, and a passion for keeping them
            healthy, PlantPal will be perfect for you. However, if one is still on-edge of giving the product
            more thought, consider the following. 

          </p>

          <p>
            an extended meter that sticks into the soil of a nearby plant and periodically obtains data.
            This data includes measurements of important factors such as <b>soil moisture, temperature,
            and humidity</b>. All of this information will then be stored within a central database; as of now,
            our team believes that <b>Microsoft Azure</b> will serve as a perfect and secure platform to host
            our product's needs. Hence, the contents of this database will be retrieved by our iOS app 
          </p>
