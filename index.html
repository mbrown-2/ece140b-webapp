          <u>Assignment 4 Update:</u> Our team's progress has been quite consistent in recent weeks - hence, we've new developments to share! As seen above, this website's slideshow of progress updates 
          is now populated with new images of mock-up designs for the intended user interface. As of now, the goal of PlantPal's mobile app is to be deployed on iOS. Hence,
          we created our designs by first iterating our thoughts via Figma Wireframing before transferring the work over onto Swift Storyboarding. These designs are still WIP and
          will continue to evolve as time progresses.
        </p>

        <p><u>Please take note!</u> This opening slideshow is in its "skeleton phase!" In other words, 
            these stock images are temporary and will be populated/replaced with images of our product in 
            the works as time progresses throughout this quarter.

            <p>
              PlantPal is the solution to your plant-caretaking woes. Our product consists of a packaged set of small meters that are inserted
              in the soil near the base of plants that you wish to track. These meters come with pre-installed batteries as well as mini solar panels
              to achieve energy sustainability for both indoor and outdoor environments.

              PlantPal is partnered with a free, downloadable app that centralizes and simplifies your experience with our product.
              This app will contain several features, such as a "plant profiling" system in which users define the type of plant that
              each unique meter is measuring. Based on these descriptions, the PlantPal meters will adapt their rate of reminders to
              produce more-specialized results.

          <h1>Product Details</h1>

          <h4>The goal of our team is to create and introduce a product that will minimize the stress of
            plant-caretaking and help users improve their gardening awareness. PlantPal is a device two
            key integrations: <u>a hardware and software side of things</u>.
          </h4>

          <div class="flexbox-description">
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The Hardware:</b> Each meter of our PlantPal package comes with a central raspberry pi,
              small rechargeable battery, (all tucked within a protective shell/case) and an extending meter. This meter sticks 
              into the soil of a nearby plant and periodically obtains data. This data includes measurements 
              of important factors such as <b>soil moisture, temperature, and humidity</b>. Every 30 minutes,
              data is forwarded via wifi to a remote server that will collect and store our data in an SQL database.
            </p>
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The software:</b> The data is aimed to be hosted on Microsoft Azure for security and reliability.
              As data is collected, a user will be able to check on this information via an iOS application on their
              mobile device. This app will retrieve data and display information in a clean and graphical layout.
              Some implementations you can expect are charts that visually describe a plant's conditions over time
              and custom settings that allow you to describe the breed and dimensions of the plants you are 
              taking care of.

          <h1>The Ideal Customer</h1>

          <p>As long as you own a mobile device, some plants that need watering, and a passion for keeping them
            healthy, PlantPal will be perfect for you. However, if one is still on-edge of giving the product
            more thought, we understand! To better understand the perspective of our consumer, our team developed
            an online interview forum and reached out to several individuals to hear their take on PlantPal's pitch.
            Perhaps, even you may share some key opinions and interests that our interviewees discussed.
          </p>

          <div class="flexbox-interviewee-responses">
            <p>"I kill plants very often and would like to be reminded to water them the correct amount especially 
              since I forget sometimes or don’t know how much to water them"</p>
            <p>"Smart technology integrated into nature without causing any severe/ drastic changes to the typical process is something I would be highly interested in"</p>
            <p>"I think this would be good for people who’ve never had a green thumb (like me) and would encourage more people to try gardening since it wouldn’t seem so difficult or daunting."</p>
            <p>"It would be very useful for me to have this app because it would let me know when to water my plant since I forgot a lot and it just helps make it a little less stressful to keep my poor plant alive."</p>
            <p>"Apps are cool" ... Indeed they are!</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            If some of these opinions and/or personal challenges align with your thoughts, you are a perfect candidate to
            for considering PlantPal as a solution to your garden gripes! PlantPal not only aims to help encourage better
            caretaking practices, but to also make the activity a fun and healthy hobby.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Our product is especially built to minimize 
            its impact upon the environment around. All important computer components are tucked within a protective shell and
            our meters are designed to turn on once every 30 minutes before re-entering sleep mode in order to minimize the heat/energy
            produced while also conserving battery life. In addition, PlantPal's affordable pricing 
            starting at $10 per pack of 5 is our aim of making our devices the most-affordable and minimal-risk products
            that one can purchase.

        <div class="flexbox-interviewee-responses">
          <p>"Affordable and reliable hardware"</p>

        <h1>Our Key Value Proposition <b>(KVP)</b></h1>

        <ol type="1" id="KVP">
          <li><u>Risk Reduction:</u>
            PlantPal's minimum-energy usage through rest-mode cycles will save battery to preserve its lifespan and minimize
            heat temperatures to prevent damaging nearby plants. Hence, all important internals will be contained within protective
            shells to protect the device from natural weather events.
          </li>

           convenience, and connectivity
          <li><u>Accessibility:</u>
            As mentioned earlier, PlantPal's price goal is $10 for a pack of 5 meters. These packs can also be purchased in several
            bulk counts for users who have larger gardens that others. Otherwise, this reasonable price should be obtainable for anyone
            who is interested. In addition, users who have access to any Apple devices will be able to use our partnered mobile app
            to its fullest capabilities.
          </li>
          <li><u>Convenience/Connectivity:</u>
            The PlantPal app can be accessed on the go as long as you have access to an internet connection. The meters themselves, on
            the other hand, are easy to turn on and insert into the soil of nearby plants. Once inserted and paired with our app, the
            meters will request permission to connect to one's wifi. From there, measurements will be automated and stored for a user to
            access and check at any time they please.
          </li>
        </ol>

        Compared to other product competitors such as XLUX and ECOWITT meters are analog and do not feature customization. On the other hand,
        PlantPal simplifies interaction and condenses the data to one's device. Our competitors tend to have information displayed on 
        the meters themselves; hence, PlantPal minimizes one's hassle and makes plant health easier to identify while on the go.

          <b>Minimizing Viscosity -</b> The "Slideshow" header was orignally front and center on the screen when the site
          would first load. I decided to remove this header, provide a bit of padding, and incorporate my first
          slideshow image into the view. It's usually easier for users to focus on images rather than text. As for the
          future, I hope to have an image of our final product as the landing image so that users have an immediate
          grasp of what our team's product is.

          <b>Principle of Visibility -</b> The positioning of the tab feature at the top of the screen felt a bit
          jarring in terms of its original appearance. At first, this horizontal bar was detached from all of the
          surrounding divs. As a result, I grouped it with the title pane to provide a sense of hierarchy to the buttons.
          Additionally, the overlap of the buttons and gray pane made the button contrast more clearly.

        <p>
          <b>Secondary Notion -</b> In continuation to the improvements of the previous topic, additional headers
          and other sub-title sections were altered/adjusted for greater clarity. More importantly, the ordering
          of sections/pages of this website are meant to encourage a flow of thought (from empathy of problem to
          the consideration of a solution to our product and its promises... etc.)

          <p>
            The first steering wheels for vehicles were - simply put - wheels. The only purpose required back 
            then was to steer a car in a direction dependent upon the driver’s intent. On the other hand, vehicles 
            of today are integrated with a variety of technologies such as comfortability options and screen displays. 
            If we consider race cars instead of the average vehicle, we can see even more options such as shifting 
            pedals and turn dials to maximize a vehicle’s performance.

            seem appropriate for the law given that all of my work is on a single, continuous page. However, the personal 
            design/goal is to create a streamline of similar ideas that carry the user from one topic to a new yet relevant 
            topic and so forth, especially without the hassle of extra button navigation. In order to differentiate these 
            ideas, I divide these sections into their own black-box dividers to proximize all text of a single idea from 
            other sections.

            I thought it’d be interesting to consider the keyboard, the very device we use almost every day in our careers 
            as programmers. The design of the keyboard is organized and grouped in the exact same layout across all versions. 
            As users, we want and expect these systems to output the exact letter or symbol that we physically press. 
            Otherwise, its implementation would be contradictory.

          <h2>User's First Interaction</h2>
          <p>
            As described in previous sections, the deliverable of this product will come in two parts: 
            hardware (the set of meters) and software (the paired app on iOS). For a user's first interaction,
            they will need to know how to place the meters into soil. This should be extremely easy as one must simply 
            push the spiked end of the meter into the ground and press its 'on' button to activate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, we expect a user to feel comfortable with basic navigation of PlantPal's paired app as long
            as the user has interacted with basic phone applications before. One simply needs to open the app as they will
            then be greeted with a vertical navigation view of a list of paired meters. Each entry can be pressed to view the details
            of the plants they measure respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only possible difficulty one might face is the matter of pairing the meters to the device. As of now, our team
            speculates (and has proven) Bluetooth capability. In this scenario, users will have to access their settings to select 
            the meters individually. Hopefully, we will be able to find a way to implement an automated feature through the app itself
            if time permits.

        <div class="ui-child">
          <h2>I.A. Design Principles</h2>
          <p>
            <u>Principle of Objects:</u> Every meter is paired with at least a single plant. Our team views the presence of our product's hardware
            as physical companions that watch over their live counterparts. A meter's role, in a sense, is to babysit a plant and provide necessary 
            health updates to the users they assist. Through the app, each  meter can show attributes of data (ie. moisture, temperature, and graphical comparisons).
          </p>

            <u>Principle of Focused Navigation:</u> In order to sort the content of our product's software, the iOS app will feature a simple
            tab-row at the bottom of the screen. As of now, we are focused on implementing three tabs: 'Overview', 'My Meters,' and 
            'Settings.' Each of these tabs should be self explanatory and contain data that is relevant to the tab's title they are sorted under.
            The 'Overview' will provide general summaries of a user's stats and notifications of current weather activity. The meters 
            tab will feature a vertical list of paired meters while the settings tab will contain accessibility options, pairing features, and more.

          <h2>Structural Principles</h2>
          <p>
            <u>Sequential Navigation:</u> So far, we've discussed our team's goals and working progress in the product's app implementation. Since we are 
            focused on applying a tab-view and vertical navigation-view, we expect the app to function in a sequential pattern. For example: let's say the 
            user seeks to view the tracked data of their PlantPal meter that is measuring a pot of sunflowers. A user will open the app and select the 
            'My Meters' tab to view their list of meters. They will then scroll through the list of names and select the meter that is measuring the said plant. 
            Performing this action will transition the screen to a 'Details' page that presents data. In addition, we should mention that the user can also select the name 
            of the meter in this Details page and edit the title so that it is more descriptive (hence why we assume in this example that the meter's name is something 
            that describes the sunflower pot and is therefore recognizable from the user's perspective). 
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Chronological:</u> We should also mention once again that our 'Details' page will feature an organized list of data and other recorded information. Given that 
            our meters measure plants periodically, the data must be stored chronologically. This is especially prevalent for our team's goal to implement a graphical view 
            (ie. a line graph that extends left to right over a course of time). This will help visualize a plant's rate of health as time goes on.

          <h1>Features vs. Benefits</h1>
          <p>
            Earlier this week, our team launched a second round of questionnaires to query user interests and see what remained the same or not. The goal was not only to re-evaluate 
            users' desires for our MVP, but also to obtain quick feedback for our current hardware and software design pitches. Hence, we compiled our 10+ responses and narrowed down the
            top 5 benefits that users seek from our product. From this, we will describe how our MVP aims to provide these benefits via its implemented features.

          </div>
          <p>
            The MVP of our product's application will focus on a single, scrollable list of meters. Since we are using SwiftUI as our platform of 
            development, we are representing the list via a navigation view where each entry is a navigation link to a Details page. In other words,
            a user can press/interact with any element of the list to jump between pages. SwiftUI is famous for its simplistic animations, in which the
            platform will help provide a scrolling animation between pages so that a user can visually follow the hierarchy of the app. Each element/meter 
            in the list will also have an arrow icon to indicate that pressing it will take the user to a different part of the app.

          <p>
            This next benefit that interviewees request is directly linked with the first benefit we described. In order to accomplish this need, our app's 
            design philosophy is functionality over appearance. This visual feature might sound detrimental, however it will help minimize user confusion when 
            navigating the app. As of now, the color palette of our MVP is white and gray with black text. We will eventually choose to integrate a different background 
            and/or theme (perhaps a blurred image or static color-background). However this decision is entirely dependent upon the amount of data and information 
            we believe is sufficient for the user to be aware of when analyzing their plants' health. If the data we require is very numerous, we will minimize the 
            UI design even further to prevent a visual overload.

          </div>
          <p>
            This next user benefit is tackled by the design features of our product's meters. Originally, our MVP seeked a solar-panel implementation so that each 
            meter would be self-sufficient and not require charging by the user. However, due to time and price restraints, the idea was swapped with a rechargeable 
            18350 battery. Each meter will come with an installed battery and the upper-portion of the meter will feature a snap-on case to shield both the battery and
            other internals from its surroundings. As a result, the costs for developing each meter is slashed; in turn, the product's price won't be too high and the 
            battery can be easily recharged/replaced in comparison to the costs of damaging a solar panel.

          </div>
          <p>
            In order to further preserve the simplicity of our application, the Details page of each meter will feature one graph or several. The final number is currently up 
            for debate as the number of graphs depends on practicality from the user's perspective. However, this feature will have a solution for either 
            decision. If we desire a single graph, the feature will hence be self-explanatory. The Details page will contain a series of bulleted data with the graph 
            positioned beneath. If we desire multiple, we will choose to preserve the same design standard for each graph (ie. each graph is a line graph so that 
            a degree of visual uniformity is maintained). The Details page is also scrollable, meaning that all of the information will not have to be crunched into a
            single static-view.

          </div>
          <p>
            The meters will have an on-button that the user will simply need to switch on once. After this, the user will open the app and select the "+" icon in 
            navigation view page. This will open a bluetooth pop-up to pair the device with each meter (either via Bluetooth or over Wi-Fi as testing confirms the
            best route for our implementation). The goal of this feature is to ensure a "one-and-done" philosophy so that a user will not have to worry about 
            re-pairing their meters with the app as they continue to interact with the product.

        <h1>Product Interactions</h1>
          <p>
            This section will function as a summary of the types of interactions that a user can engage with in relationship to the features we described above.
          </p>
          <h4>Hardware-Side</h4>
          <p>
            Once again, we recognize PlantPal as a product with a hardware and software side-of-things. The hardware consists of the series of meters that a user
            decides to purchase. The interactions required for dealing with this product are straight-forward. One must simply check their plants or garden and select 
            the appropriate locations they believe are practical for inserting their meters at. Each meter will come with a battery; if one must either swap the batteries 
            or exchange the dome-covering of a meter, one must lift the snap-on dome to access the battery or exchange the dome itself.
          </p>
          <h4>Software-Side</h4>
          <p>
            The application is where we expect our user to spend 99% of their time in the grand-scheme of things. A user will use the app to accomplish three main 
            actions: pairing a meter, viewing its data, and editing a meter's details. The user lands on a center page that is reserved to show the list of paired 
            meters that are organized in a scrollable column. The top of the page features a "+" icon that a user selects. This will prompt the app to search for 
            a new meter via Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi, depending on how our finishing tests pan out). A list of unpaired meters will appear and a user can simply tap the 
            device they seek so that it is paired. This will then populate the list with the said meter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, data is collected. When a user wishes to view the details of what a meter has recorded, they will press the meter on the column which will open 
            a Details page. This section will also be scrollable as it will provide a summary of all relevant data. If a user wishes to edit the meter's name or un-pair it,
            they will be able to select an "Edit" button/icon at the top right of the page. Otherwise, they can select a "back" button at the top left to navigate backward to 
            the list of meters.
