          <h2>Welcome!</h2>

           <p>PlantPal is the solution to your plant-caretaking woes. Our product consists of a packaged set of small meters that are inserted
            in the soil near the base of plants that you wish to track. These meters come with pre-installed batteries as well as mini solar panels
            to achieve energy sustainability for both indoor and outdoor environments.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>PlantPal is partnered with a free, downloadable app that centralizes and simplifies your experience with our product.
            This app will contain several features, such as a "plant profiling" system in which users define the type of plant that
            each unique meter is measuring. Based on these descriptions, the PlantPal meters will adapt their rate of reminders to
            produce more-specialized results.

          <h1>Product Details</h1>

          <h4>The goal of our team is to create and introduce a product that will minimize the stress of
            plant-caretaking and help users improve their gardening awareness. PlantPal is a device two
            key integrations: <u>a hardware and software side of things</u>.
          </h4>

          <div class="flexbox-description">
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The Hardware:</b> Each meter of our PlantPal package comes with a central raspberry pi,
              small rechargeable battery, (all tucked within a protective shell/case) and an extending meter. This meter sticks 
              into the soil of a nearby plant and periodically obtains data. This data includes measurements 
              of important factors such as <b>soil moisture, temperature, and humidity</b>. Every 30 minutes,
              data is forwarded via wifi to a remote server that will collect and store our data in an SQL database.
            </p>
            <p class="flex-p">
              <b>The software:</b> The data is aimed to be hosted on Microsoft Azure for security and reliability.
              As data is collected, a user will be able to check on this information via an iOS application on their
              mobile device. This app will retrieve data and display information in a clean and graphical layout.
              Some implementations you can expect are charts that visually describe a plant's conditions over time
              and custom settings that allow you to describe the breed and dimensions of the plants you are 
              taking care of.
            </p>
          </div>


          <h1>Is this product for me?</h1>

          <p>As long as you own a mobile device, some plants that need watering, and a passion for keeping them
            healthy, PlantPal will be perfect for you. However, if one is still on-edge of giving the product
            more thought, we understand! To better understand the perspective of our consumer, our team developed
            an online interview forum and reached out to several individuals to hear their take on PlantPal's pitch.
            Perhaps, even you may share some key opinions and interests that our interviewees discussed.
          </p>

          <div class="flexbox-interviewee-responses">
            <p>"I kill plants very often and would like to be reminded to water them the correct amount especially 
              since I forget sometimes or don’t know how much to water them"</p>
            <p>"Smart technology integrated into nature without causing any severe/ drastic changes to the typical process is something I would be highly interested in"</p>
            <p>"I think this would be good for people who’ve never had a green thumb (like me) and would encourage more people to try gardening since it wouldn’t seem so difficult or daunting."</p>
            <p>"It would be very useful for me to have this app because it would let me know when to water my plant since I forgot a lot and it just helps make it a little less stressful to keep my poor plant alive."</p>
            <p>"Apps are cool" ... Indeed they are!</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            If some of these opinions and/or personal challenges align with your thoughts, you are a perfect candidate to
            for considering PlantPal as a solution to your garden gripes! PlantPal not only aims to help encourage better
            caretaking practices, but to also make the activity a fun and healthy hobby.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Our product is especially built to minimize 
            its impact upon the environment around. All important computer components are tucked within a protective shell and
            our meters are designed to turn on once every 30 minutes before re-entering sleep mode in order to minimize the heat/energy
            produced while also conserving battery life. In addition, PlantPal's affordable pricing 
            starting at $10 per pack of 5 is our aim of making our devices the most-affordable and minimal-risk products
            that one can purchase.
          </p>

          <h1>What will I get out of using PlantPal?</h1>
          

        </div>

        <div class="flexbox-interviewee-responses">
          <p>Affordable and reliable hardware</p>
          <p>A free, downloadable application that can be accessed anywhere and on the go</p>
          <p>Energy efficient and eco-friendly hardware design</p>
          <p>Easy-to-use meter technology</p>

        <h1>Our Key Value Proposition</h1>

        <ol type="1" id="KVP">
          <li><u>Risk Reduction:</u>
            PlantPal's minimum-energy usage through rest-mode cycles will save battery to preserve its lifespan and minimize
            heat temperatures to prevent damaging nearby plants. Hence, all important internals will be contained within protective
            shells to protect the device from natural weather events.
          </li>

           convenience, and connectivity
          <li><u>Accessibility:</u>
            As mentioned earlier, PlantPal's price goal is $10 for a pack of 5 meters. These packs can also be purchased in several
            bulk counts for users who have larger gardens that others. Otherwise, this reasonable price should be obtainable for anyone
            who is interested. In addition, users who have access to any Apple devices will be able to use our partnered mobile app
            to its fullest capabilities.
          </li>
          <li><u>Convenience/Connectivity:</u>
            The PlantPal app can be accessed on the go as long as you have access to an internet connection. The meters themselves, on
            the other hand, are easy to turn on and insert into the soil of nearby plants. Once inserted and paired with our app, the
            meters will request permission to connect to one's wifi. From there, measurements will be automated and stored for a user to
            access and check at any time they please.
          </li>
        </ol>

        Compared to other product competitors such as XLUX and ECOWITT meters are analog and do not feature customization. On the other hand,
        PlantPal simplifies interaction and condenses the data to one's device. Our competitors tend to have information displayed on 
        the meters themselves; hence, PlantPal minimizes one's hassle and makes plant health easier to identify while on the go.
